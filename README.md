# Kronos

This is my first full design for a 3D printer, it's heavily based on the Ultimaker, Tantillu, Eustathios and Herculian designs.
My idea is to replace my existing Prusa i2 using this design.

It has the following design principles.
* Uses a standard 200x200 heated bed print base
* Uses 20x20 aluminium extrusion
* Uses 8mm round bar
* Has as small a footprint as possible
* Allow encapsulation of the print volume to make a heated chamber
* All parts should work at 20% infill
* Fillets and rounded corners used extensively
* Be easy for others to modify (probably going to use OpenScad)

All measurements and parts are going to be in metric.
