# Kronos

This is my first full design for a 3D printer, it's heavily based on the Ultimaker, Tantillus, Eustathios and Herculian designs.
My idea is to replace my existing Prusa i2 using this design.

It has the following design principles.
* Uses a standard 200x200 heated bed print base
* Uses 20x20 aluminium extrusion
* Uses 8mm round bar
* Has as small a footprint as possible
* Allow encapsulation of the print volume to make a heated chamber
* All parts should work at default infill (20% cura, 40% Slic3r)
* Fillets and rounded corners used extensively
* Be easy for others to modify (probably going to use OpenScad)

All measurements and parts are going to be in metric.

## Bill of materials so far (£96.44)

* 20x20 extrusion - bought from ebay as 5x1m lengths and cut down (6m for £30)
  * 4 x 400mm verticals (holes at 10mm from top, 100mm from top and 290mm from top)
  * 10 x 300mm horizontals (all tapped in the centre hole with M5 tap)
  * Spare lengths to be used for bed support
* 4 x 608zz bearings (10 for £1.99)
* 4 x 8x12x20 Oilite Metric Plain Oil Filled Sintered Bronze Bush (5 for £13.90)
* 8 x GT2 pulley 20 teeth (£23.40)
* 10m GT2 6mm timing belt (£19.99)
* M5
  * M5 nuts with two edges ground off to fit into extrusion as nuts (100 pack £0.49 toolstation)
  * M5x20 Cap head (50 pack - £2.92 toolstation)
  * M5x12 Button head (50 pack - £1.78 toolstation)
  * M5x16 Button head (50 pack - £1.97 toolstation)
